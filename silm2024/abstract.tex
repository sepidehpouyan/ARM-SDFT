ARM TrustZone is a dominant security technology in embedded processors,
mobile devices and in the Internet of Things. While TrustZone enables
software isolation where critical code executes in a ``secure world'' that
is protected from direct access from less critical code, side-channel
vulnerabilities are outside of the isolation model: secret-dependent
behavior in vulnerable programs may be observed from the normal world,
compromising the confidentiality of secure-world programs. In this paper we
present a tool that uses symbolic execution and static analysis to detect
timing side channels in compiled programs for ARM's light-weight Cortex-M
processors. We evaluate our approach on previously published benchmarks and
attacks, showing that our tool \tool{} exhibits high accuracy in detecting
a range of side-channel vulnerabilities, specifically in the TrustZone
secure world. To the best of our knowledge, \tool{} is the first
side-channel detection tool tailored for ARM TrustZone, which we make
available under an open-source license.
