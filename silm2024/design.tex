\section{Objectives \& Analysis} \label{sect:design}
%
% While TrustZone technology in ARMv8-M processors offers robust security
% measures, it remains susceptible to side channel attacks due to
% secret-dependent control flow, resulting in observable timing variations or
% secret-dependent memory access patterns~\cite{armdeveloper}. Furthermore,
% TrustZone does not mitigate implicit and explicit information leaks
% resulting from unintentional developer errors in secure coding practices,
% system architecture flaws, and non-compliance with stringent security
% standards and protocols.

Our objective is to develop an approach that merges taint tracking techniques
with symbolic execution of \ac{TA} binaries to
systematically identify undesired information leakage. Subsequently, we
notify developers of these identified leakage points for
further action and resolution. 

\subsection{Scope \& Adversary}
%
\paragraph{\textbf{Scope}} Our focus revolves around small-scale embedded
systems and IoT devices that operate using MCUs, such as the Arm Cortex-M
family. These MCUs operate within strict constraints, characterized by
limited computing power and memory. They feature simplified
microarchitectures, lacking components like caches and typically operating
with 2-3 pipeline stages. Additionally, they do not support virtual memory.
Generally, MCUs consist of a single CPU while offering a diverse array of
peripherals, including UART, SPI, timers, DMAs, and I2C, among others. Some
devices may incorporate MPUs, and the latest iterations of Armv8-M MCUs
introduce support for dual security states, namely secure and non-secure
worlds (known as TrustZone-M). These MCUs are engineered to ensure highly
predictable outcomes, consistently delivering identical outputs for
specific inputs within defined timing constraints.

\paragraph{\textbf{Adversary}} The adversary’s goal is to extract
sensitive information from an isolated environment by bypassing the memory
isolation security mechanisms in TrustZone. We assume the attacker has
access to either the source code or compiled binary code of the victim's
program. Additionally, they can monitor the program's execution time and
outputs. Furthermore, we consider a more capable attacker who has complete
control over the unprotected normal world and its resources. This includes
the ability to manage bus masters (e.g., DMA), configure peripherals like
timers, and control scheduling decisions. We are not considering side
channels arising from cache contention or branch prediction feature, as
they fall beyond the scope of this work due to their absence in the
targeted MCU architecture.


\subsection{An Example: OTP}

Consider a secure \ac{OTP} system illustrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:OTP}, which could be involved in verifying mobile users
accessing web services. An \ac{OTP} is a dynamically generated numeric or
alphanumeric string of characters used to authenticate a user for a single
transaction or session with an authentication server. This approach
augments the traditional user ID and password authentication by introducing
a dynamic password that changes with each authentication attempt. The
\ac{OTP} mechanism operates by generating a code using an internal clock
(or counter) and a factory-encoded secret key known as the 'seed.' To
maintain the confidentiality of both the generated \acp{OTP} and the seeds,
the code and data involved in \ac{OTP} operations inhabit the secure world
of TrustZone~\cite{trustotp}, guaranteeing the integrity and
confidentiality by restricting access exclusively to the secure domain.

However, any inadvertent mishandling of the seeds or \acp{OTP} -- such as
storing them in unprotected memory, logging them, or exposed
via non-secure I/O, or if an implicit flow is triggered by updating a
publicly observable variable within the program control flow -- could
possibly lead to (parts of) program secrets becoming observable by
adversaries.  could potentially access the generated \acp{OTP}.

\subsection{Taint Tracking of Function Inputs}

Our method involves an information flow analysis that links each value with
a security tag indicating its sensitivity level. We categorize
these levels into two labels: '\textit{H}' for high sensitivity and
'\textit{L}' for low sensitivity. Each input (initial state of registers,
etc.) and output (final state of registers, etc.) of a program is assigned
one of these labels. To track and identify both explicit and
implicit data flows of high sensitivity during program execution, our
approach incorporates a symbolic taint-tracking mechanism.

Specifically, initial register contents and associated memory are
transparently substituted with unconstrained symbolic values. We,
furthermore, utilize Angr’s annotation systemi~\cite{angr} to flag 
sensitive symbolic values as tainted. This taint, conservatively propagated
throughout symbolic execution, allows for querying during
subsequent analysis to identify potential information leakage. 

\subsection{Timing-Sensitive Information Flow Policy}

An information-flow analysis verifies the absence of undesired information
leakage within a program. A timing-sensitive variant of this analysis
considers the impact of confidential data on the program's execution time.
The intended security assurance is typically defined through information
flow policies that prevent secret data from affecting an attacker's
observations. This study utilizes a symbolic taint-tracking strategy to
monitor potential policy violations during execution.

Taint tags follow Angr's propagation rules during symbolic
program execution, aligning with ARMv8-M instruction semantics. For
example, in the case of an instruction like ‘ADD dst, src1, src2’, a taint
propagation rule defines that the resulting tag of 'dst' is
determined by performing a bit-wise OR operation on the tags of ‘src1’ and
‘src2’. These rules imposes constraints on the sensitivity of
data stored in registers and memory cells throughout program execution. 

\subsection{Detection of timing side channels}

To ensure the absence of timing side channels within a program, our
approach involves the initial computation of control-dependence regions for
each branch instruction dependent on secret data. This employs
Safe Over-Approximation Properties~\cite{MantelAVR}. In particular, our focus lies in comparing the
execution times between the 'then' and 'else' branches, distinguishing two
distinct control-dependence regions for jumps influenced by confidential
information.
Afterward, we sums up the execution time of all instructions within each
region.

% In scenarios
% where a nested branch exists within the region of another
% branch, a recursive procedure becomes necessary due to only
% one path of being executed, whereas the positive part of
% \textit{Definition}~\ref{def:timing} accounts for both paths' cumulative
% execution time. We address this by subtracting the execution time of the
% 'then' branch of \textit{br1}.
% 
% \newtheorem{definition}{Definition}[section]
% \begin{definition}\label{def:timing}
%     The function \textbf{branchPathTime\textsuperscript{r}} is defined recursively as: \\
%    
%    \noindent 
%    $branchPathTime^r(br) := $ \\
%      $\Sigma (execution\_time(ins) -$ \\
%      $ branchPathTime^{then}(ins))$
% 
%    Where:
% \begin{align*}
% & \bullet \quad r \in \{ \text{then}, \text{else} \} \\
% & \bullet \quad br \in \{ \text{beq}, \text{bne}, \text{bgt}, \text{blt}, \text{bge}, \text{ble} \} \\
% & \bullet \quad \forall \text{ins} \in \text{region}^r(br)
% \end{align*}
% 
% \end{definition}

Within ARMv8-M architecture, conditional branch instructions require an
extra clock cycle when they are taken: if the total time
required for executing the 'then' region plus one equals the time taken for
jumping and executing the 'else' region in a secret-dependent branch, it
becomes impossible to discern the value of secret data by observing the
program's overall execution time.

Furthermore, identifying the Nemesis vulnerability in an ARMv8-M binary
involves pinpointing a jump instruction depending on secret data. Due to
the variable execution times of branch instructions in ARMv8-M architecture
when taken or not, an attacker can interrupt a branch instruction to
capture the secret information. Consequently, the attacker can even execute
a Nemesis attack on balanced paths.

To detect the BUSted vulnerability, we traverse
every path within a branch dependent on secret information, scrutinizing
the execution points of 'str' or 'ldr' instructions. If these instructions
execute at different clock offsets on conditional paths, it exposes a
potential vulnerability for attackers to exploit distinct memory access
patterns and gain access to sensitive information.

\subsection{Augmented Taint Flow Directives}

Secret-dependent branches introduce variations in the program flow based on
confidential information. By observing changes in execution time, logical
operations, or other side channel information arising from these branches,
attackers can deduce details about the secret data, such as its value or
structure. Consequently, when a secret-dependent branch involves an
operation where a memory cell or register is written within a particular
path, it's crucial to mark that register or memory as tainted.
% These
% elements carry highly sensitive information during program execution,
% causing variations that attackers can exploit to infer the secret.

We employ Angr’s MemoryMixin extension, which conducts exhaustive
validations on every memory access. When these accesses occur
within secret-dependent branches, we annotate the symbolic
values as tainted to reflect their elevated sensitivity within that
particular context. This approach guarantees the detection of flows from
secret information to attacker-observable outputs.
